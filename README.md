# Treasure Island Python Exercise
This is my take on the classic "Treasure Island" text-based adventure game implemented in Python.

## Description

This game is a simple text-based adventure where the player starts on the shore of a mysterious island and must navigate through different paths and challenges to find the treasure.

## What I Did

- **Game Start**: Implemented a clear screen function to make the game interface cleaner.
- **Press Enter**: Implemented a function to wait for the user to press Enter to continue after clearing the screen.
- **Game Over Art**: Added ASCII art for the game over screen to enhance the user experience.
- **Choices**: Presented the user with three paths (left, right, middle) to choose from at the beginning of the game.
- **Left Path**: Created a scenario where the user encounters a guardian and must solve a riddle to proceed.
- **Right Path**: Implemented a scenario where the user must choose between three doors in a dark cave.
- **Middle Path**: Implemented a scenario where the user gets lost in a dense forest and perishes.
